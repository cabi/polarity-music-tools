# polarity music tools

All sounds & presets are created by myself. you can use it in your productions.

I created a new Github repository for all my music production stuff, which I already offered for download and which I will offer in the future. So presets, projects & samples. I already linked all my resources in the individual Youtube videos and on my website, but I wanted a more central and up-to-date place.
